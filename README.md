# Movies-ETL

## Overview of the analysis

1.	Create an ETL pipeline from raw data to a SQL database.
2.	Extract data from disparate sources using Python.
3.	Clean and transform data using Pandas.
4.	Use regular expressions (Regex) to parse data and to transform text into numbers.
5.	Load data with PostgreSQL and verify in PgAdmin.


## Purpose and Analysis

    The purpose is to create an automated pipeline that takes in new data, performs the appropriate transformations, and loads the data into existing tables. Refactor the code to create one function that takes in the three files—Wikipedia data, Kaggle metadata, and the MovieLens rating data—and performs the ETL process by adding the data to a PostgreSQL database
